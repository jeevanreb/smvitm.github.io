		<h3> PROVIDING VALUE-ADDED, HOLISTIC ENGINEERING EDUCATION </h3>
		
		<p> Founded in 2010 by H. H. Shri Vishwavallabha Theertha Swamiji of Shri Sode Vadiraja Mutt 
		– one of the 700 plus years old Ashta Mutts associated with the world famous Shri Krishna temple o
		f Udupi in Karnataka – Shri MadhwaVadiraja Institute of Technology & Management (SMVITM), situated at
		Bantakal in Udupi has carved a niche for itself in imparting quality engineering education in the coastal
		Karnataka region. Shri Swamiji started the institute with the sublime objective of providing quality higher
		education to the needy student community at affordable costs. The motto Engineering your Career and Character 
		with Care well reflects the objectives and philosophy of the institute. Despite, being the youngest institute in
		the region, SMVITM has made remarkable strides in its journey towards excellence over the past five years and has
		emerged as the most promising engineering institute with its well-qualified and motivated faculty, state-of-the-art 
		infrastructure and distinguished learning-centric facilities. </p>

        <h5> B.Tech in Computer Science</h5>
        </a>

        <p>Today, most of the real world activities and fields, right from calculations to space exploration are being 
          computerized as the operations can be much faster and error free with the computer applications. This has resulted 
          in an increased demand for skilled and competent professionals in the computer engineering sector. To cater to this,
           the Department of Computer Science & Engineering was established at SMVITM in 2010, offering Bachelor of Engineering 
           course with an intake of 60 students per year.<br/>
